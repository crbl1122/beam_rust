Rust can be used together with the modern Apache Beam framework, taking the best of the two worlds: distributed computing environment in Apache beam, with fast and secure multi-core CPUs parallel execution of compute-intensive tasks or data processing operations in Rust.

This repo shows how Rust can be used within Apache Beam pipelines, using Python SDK.
